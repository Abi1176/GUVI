# Zomato Food Delivery Data Insights
1. Project Overview
As a data scientist at Zomato, the goal of this project is to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction by analyzing food delivery data. The interactive Streamlit tool enables seamless data entry and management of orders, customers, restaurants, and deliveries. The system supports robust database operations like adding columns or creating new tables dynamically while maintaining compatibility with existing code.
2. Source Code
This project consists of multiple Python scripts for dataset generation, database management, and Streamlit app development. The key components are:
a. Dataset Generation (datasetGenerator.py)
Generates synthetic food delivery data.
Exports data in CSV format for initial database seeding.
b. Database Management (DBConnection.py)
Establishes a connection to an MySQL Database.
Provides functions to create, update, and query tables dynamically.
Ensures compatibility with existing schema.
c. Streamlit App (ZomatoStreamlit.py)
Interactive interface for data entry and real-time analysis.
Allows users to insert, update, and view records.
Supports on-the-fly schema modifications.
3. Streamlit App
The Streamlit app is the front-end of this tool, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and analyzing food delivery data.
Key Features:
Data Entry: Users can add new records for orders, customers, restaurants, and deliveries.
Dynamic Table Management: Ability to create new tables or add columns dynamically.
Visual Analytics: Data visualization through interactive charts.
SQL Query Execution: Run custom SQL queries for deeper insights.

5. SQL Queries for Data Analysis
Below are 20 SQL queries to analyze food delivery trends:
Total number of orders placed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_order_details;
Most popular restaurant:
SELECT restaurant_id, COUNT(*) as order_count FROM tbl_order_details GROUP BY restaurant_id ORDER BY order_count DESC LIMIT 1;
Average order value:
SELECT AVG(total_amount) From tbl_order_details;
Count of customers who placed more than 5 orders:
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
Number of pending orders:
SELECT COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details WHERE status = 'Pending';
Orders by cuisine type:
SELECT r.cuisine_type, COUNT(o.order_id) From tbl_order_details o JOIN tbl_restaurant r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id GROUP BY r.cuisine_type;
Top 5 customers based on total spending:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent From tbl_order_details GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 5;
Orders completed within 30 minutes:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_deliveries WHERE delivery_time - order_date <= INTERVAL '30 MINUTES';
Percentage of completed deliveries:
SELECT (COUNT(*) FILTER(WHERE delivery_status = 'Completed') * 100.0) / COUNT(*) AS completion_rate FROM tbl_deliveries;
Average delivery time:
SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM delivery_time - order_date) / 60) AS avg_delivery_time FROM tbl_deliveries;
Restaurant with the highest revenue:
SELECT restaurant_id, SUM(total_amount) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY restaurant_id ORDER BY SUM(total_amount) DESC LIMIT 1;
Orders by month:
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY month;
Customer retention rate:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_customers) From tbl_order_details;
Percentage of orders that include delivery:
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details) FROM tbl_deliveries;
Restaurant with the most late deliveries:
SELECT restaurant_id, COUNT(*) FROM tbl_deliveries WHERE delivery_status = 'Pending' GROUP BY restaurant_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
Average number of items per order:
SELECT AVG(item_count) From tbl_order_details;
Peak order hours:
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_date) AS hour, COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY hour ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
Revenue per customer:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY customer_id;
Most frequently ordered item:
SELECT cuisine_type, COUNT(*) FROM tbl_restaurant GROUP BY item_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
Order frequency per restaurant:
SELECT restaurant_id, COUNT(*) From tbl_order_details GROUP BY restaurant_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
